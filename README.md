## Reasoning

I'm posting these scripts here, in case they are needed later. Although most of them aren't hard to code, still nice to have them here.

### clearDownloads.py

Basically run through the files in the downloads directory, and moves them to a university directory if they are a pdf file. (Could backfire, but overall it works fine)

### marioStairs.py

Was watching a YT shorts about this, and was wondering if I was able to code it myself. (Yes, it's a simple code, but I wanted to do it still)

### links.py

This program is designed to open pre-defined links in the browser. Useful for websites that aren't saved in the bookmarks.
