## Reasoning

I'm posting these spripts here, in case I need them later. Although they aren't hard to code, and may not be incredibly useful, still fun to have them here.

### clearDownloads.py

Basically run through the files in the downloads directory, and moves them to a university directory if they are a pdf file. (I know it could backfire, but overall it works fine)

### marioStairs.py

Was watching a YT shorts about this, and was wondering if I was able to code it myself. (Yes, it's a simple code, but I wanted to do it still)
